Design and Analysis of Algorithms 

> " Your program will accept two separate unsorted input files 
of numbers with equal number of lines as input. 
Each number is separated by EOL. Load first file into a LinkedList and 
then load second file into a LinkedList. 
Compute the pairwise product of the elements of 
these two lists. Then do the same for Queue.
Compare the time spent for two data structures "


## How it is work?
- Program accepts two unsorted equal files from terminal.
- Files are added into linked-list and queue.
- Compute pairwise product for each pair of types. Basically the algorithm takes same indexes from list and products them.
- Prints spent time for two data structures while calculating pairwise product.
